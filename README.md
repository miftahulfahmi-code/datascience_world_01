# datascience_world_01: _Things you might miss as a Data Scientist: Geospatial Data Analytics_

This World Theme: "**Spatial Data Science**" üåéüåçüíê

Why Geospatial?
It is beautiful to understand the data and environment as a CLOUD!
Imagine you want to see how spread our world is, how socio-economic affects in each cities, then we need to fly further (helicopter viewer).
With visualization, especially geospatial, you can see how spread an information is to extend of some areas, at a glimpse.

Here, I will teach you some important tricks related to Geospatial Data Science using python language. I put detailed code below, please study carefully guys, because I make it all crystal clear!

This Repository will teach you two parts using PYTHON (**please click on the respective links below!**)

(1) Learn the basic of **Data Cleaning and Visualization**: pandas, numpy. Visualization of graph using MAT PLOTLY and SEABORN. You can visualize geographical information (GPKG) using OSMNx.

(2) Learn the basic of **Data Integration** (Combine data from different sources) and **REGRESSION** (simplest part of unsupervised machine learning). Here, we will use SKLEARN as the main part of Regression analysis. Please click here [https://miftahulfahmi-code.github.io/datascience_world_01/spatial_analysis_REGRESSION.html]

**Some welcoming message to you, learners!**

Hello, everyone! I hope you a beautiful day.

My name is Miftahul Fahmi, currently studying Management of Technology in Delft University of Technology. Here are some related assignments of my data science courses, which I take on November 2023 - April 2024. So, there will be more of codes that I will post here.

**Seriously, why I need to post my codes here? The answer is simple:**

**I love programming!** and data science sparks a new spirit for me. Putting my code here will make me easier to review my old codes for future needs, anytime and anywhere (instead of checking on my old folders). Also, I believe my way of coding (I got the way of coding from class lab, and some with the help of ChatGPT. Yes but i dont blindly copy paste) and explanation will help you.
I posted assignments that has high grades only (it means that the supervisors could guarantee the quality).
Please, enjoy!
