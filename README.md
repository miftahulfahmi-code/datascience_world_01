Hello, everyone! I hope you a beautiful day.

My name is Miftahul Fahmi, currently studying Management of Technology in Delft University of Technology. Here are some related assignments of my data science courses, which I take on November 2023 - April 2024. So, there will be more of codes that I will post here.

Seriously, why I need to post my codes here? The answer is simple:

I love programming! and data science sparks a new spirit for me. Putting my code here will make me easier to review my old codes for future needs, anytime and anywhere (instead of checking on my old folders). Also, I believe my way of coding (I got the way of coding from class lab, and some with the help of ChatGPT. Yes but i dont blindly copy paste) and explanation will help you.
I posted assignments that has high grades only (it means that the supervisors could guarantee the quality).
Please, enjoy!
